# Interactive Shiny Dashboard Using Plotly, Highcharter And Leaflet

In this project, we have built an interactive shiny dashboard using different libraries such as leaflet, plotly,
and highcharter. Interactive visualizations always capture attention and help to understand details more easily.
In our interactive dashboard, we have presented different visualizations like boxplots, stacked bar plot, spline
chart and leaflet maps with advanced features. The dashboard helps us to give some knowledge about statewide population
density, statewide median income, statewide math proficiency of 4th-grade students and top 100 schools as well as top 
100 universities in the United States.
